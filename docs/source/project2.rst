2. You should have the files you downloaded for earlier project. 
3. please use reference sequence located at /mnt/disks/data/students/ananta/ref/IRGSP-1.0_genome.fasta
4. perform FastQC on your files.
5. Map paired end data to the reference genome. 
6. convert to bam, sort and index
7. Get mapping statistics with flagstat, idxstats
8. Run variant calling. 
9. How many variants were found?
